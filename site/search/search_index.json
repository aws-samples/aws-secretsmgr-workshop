You should be familiar with Docker concepts. Overview In this phase, you will learn how to use AWS Secrets Manager with AWS Fargate. AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon Elastic Container Service that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. AWS Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them. The CloudFormation template for this workshop round created a Dockerfile and some helper shell scripts. You will use these shell scripts to build the Docker image and push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), a fully-managed Docker container registry. This guide does not go into the details of these scripts. You are encouraged to read them to learn what they do to gain a better understanding of Docker, Amazon ECR, and AWS Fargate. Lastly as a reminder, the environment provisioned by CloudFormation is shown in the figure below. Build and push the Docker image If you are do not have a session open to the bastion host, then connect to the bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. To do this: Go to the Systems Manager console. Select Session Manager . Click Start session . Select the radio button for the instance associated with the bastion host. Click Start session . The scripts you will be using are owned by the ec2-user account. If you are not currently using ec2-user as your effective user id, then enter the command below to change your effective user id and directory to those of ec2-user: sudo su - ec2-user Run this script to build the Docker image: ./dockerbuild.sh This command creates the Docker image based on the Dockerfile that was generated by CloudFormation. The build process can take a few minutes to complete. Wait until the shell prompts you for another command before continuing. Confirm that the image was built by using this command: docker images You should see a repository whose name contans -ecrre- that was recently built. Run the following script to push the image to Amazon ECR to make the image available to AWS Fargate: dockertagandpush.sh This script will take a few minutes to complete. Wait until the shell prompt appears before continuing. You have now built the Docker image and pushed it to Amazon ECR. You will now configure AWS Fargate. Configure and launch AWS Fargate You will now configure the Amazon Elastic Container Service Task Definition that AWS Fargate will use to launch the task. After you confgure the task definition, you will launch the AWS Fargate task. Go to the ECS Console window and select the Clusters menu item. You should see a cluster whose name begins with the stack name you chose and contains the string -ECSCluster- . The cluster description should look similar to that shown in the figure below. Click the Task Definitions menu item. You should see a task definition whose name contains -TaskDefinition- as shown below. Click the check box next to the appropriate task definition name and then click Create new revision . Leave all of the current values in place. Scroll down and click Configure via JSON . Look for the list named secrets . It should look similar to what is shown in the figure below. Replace SECRETNAME with the name of the secret you stoed in the RDS phase. Click Save to save the revised JSON definition. Click Create to create the new revision of the Task Definition that includes the JSON revisions. You will see a message saying that the new revision has been created. Notice that the revision has a version number attached to it as shown in the figure below. Click the Actions button and select Run Task from the dropdown menu. Choose the values listed in the table below. Field Value Launch type Fargate Cluster VPC The VPC that was created by CloudFormation with the 10.200.0.0/16 subnet Subnets Select all of the subnets listed Security group Select the group whose name includes BastionSG Leave all other values at their current settings. Click Run Task . Refresh the Task window at the bottom to update the status. The status will start at PROVISIONING , then change to PENDING , and then to RUNNING*. Now that you have launched the Fargate task, you are ready to connect to the container. Connect to the Fargate contaner Click on the task name to display details of the task and note the private IP associated with the task. The private IP should begin with 10.200 . The third octet should be either 11 or 12. This private IP of the Fargate task has been connected to your VPC. From the Systems Manager Session Manager session you started above, while sudo'd as ec2-user, enter the following command: ssh PrvateIpOfFargateTask Replace PrivateIPOfFargateTask with the private IP of the Fargate task. You will be prompted for the password. Enter the value from the EC2UserPassword output value from the CloudFormation stack. You should now see a shell prompt. Access the database Now that you have connected to the AWS Fargate container, you can now access the RDS database. After you access the database you will learn how the scripts receive the secret value from the ECS Task Definition. Run the command below to access the RDS database. Note that you do not supply the name of a secret since that has been passed in the task definition. ./mysql.newway.sh The output should be similar to what you see in the figure below. Examine the flow of the secret Now that you have been able to access the database through Fargate, it's important to understand how the value made its way from the Task Definition to the mysql.newway.sh script. It's important to understand that there may be multiple ways to accomplish this depending on what is running in the container. Since this container is running a Linux shell, the path the secret value flowed took advantage of the capabilities of the shell. In the task definition JSON that you modified above, you modified the value of the valueFrom key to be the ARN of the secret that you stored in Secrets Manager. The corresponding name key has as its value the name of an environment variable that will be presented to the Fargate task container when it is instantiated. The Dockerfile that is used to build the Docker image for Fargate has the following as its last line: CMD /home/ec2-user/startprocesses.sh This means that when Fargate launches the Docker image, the image will run the startproceses.sh file. Here are the contents of the main portion of that file: touch /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh env | \\ grep \"^TASKDEF_\" | \\ awk -F= '{printf \"export %s=%c%s%c\\n\", $1, 39, $2, 39 }' \\ &gt;&gt; /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh You can see that the startprocesses.sh script creates another script named /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh. Each line in ecs.sh contains the definitions of every environment variable passed to the container whose environment variable names start with TASKDEF_ . Since the file exists in the /etc/profile.d directory, each time a user logs in, the ecs.sh file willl be \"sourced\" by the shell causing the environment variables to be set for the logged in user. To confirm that the secret value has been passed, enter the following command from the Fargate container shell prompt: env|grep TASKDEF_SECRET You should see a value similar to that in the figure below. This shows that the Task Definition properly retrieved the secret information and passed it to the Fargate container which in turn made it available to the login shell. Conclusion You have completed ths Fargate phase and have learned how to use AWS Secrets Manager with AWS Fargate. Please proceed to the Clean up phase to remove the environment created by AWS CloudFormation.","title":"Fargate phase"},{"location":"RDSFargate/Fargate/#rds-and-fargate-round-fargate-phase","text":"","title":"RDS and Fargate Round - Fargate Phase"},{"location":"RDSFargate/Fargate/#prerequisites","text":"You must complete the RDS phase of this workshop round before starting this phase.

As a reminder, the environment provisioned by CloudFormation is shown in the figure below. You will not be working with the AWS Fargate container in this phase. Security Note For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial uses jq to parse the secret value into environment variables to allow for easy command line manipulation. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables. View the CloudFormation stack Go to the CloudFormation console and identify the stack that you built. The list of stacks will look similar to the figure below. The appearance may vary based on the version of the console you are using. The red arrow points to a link with the name of the CloudFormation stack. Click the stack name link to reveal more information about the stack as shown in the figure below. Click the Outputs tab as shown in the figure above to list the outputs of the stack which will be similar to the figure below. The meanings of the output values are described in the table below. Key Meaning of Value BastionIP The IP address of the bastion host DBInstance The Amazon RDS instance id DBPassword The master password of the RDS data base DBUser The master user of the RDS data base EC2UserPassword The password for the ec2-user id ECRRepository The ECR repository id ECSCluster The ECS cluster id You will need the values in the DBInstance, DBPassword, and DBUser outputs in the next section so copy them to a file on your desktop so they are readily available. Store the secret In this section, you will store the RDS database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Open the AWS Secrets Manager Console in a new tab or window. Click Store a new secret . Select the Credentials for RDS database radio button. Copy the values for the DBUser and DBPassword CloudFormation output values that you got from the CloudFormation stack into the User name and Password fields respectively. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will see a list of your RDS instances. Select the RDS instance based on the DBInstance CloudFormation output value. Click Next . Enter a name for the secret. You can pick a name or just use smdemo as shown below. Note that this must bot be the name of a secret that is pending deletion. Click Next . Select Disable automatic rotation and then click Next . We will enable rotation later in this module. Click Store . You have now stored your secret value as shown below. Access the database before the rotation In this section, you will connect to the bastion host so you can run scripts that the CloudFormation template has created on the instance. Complete all the steps below unless they are marked \"optional.\" Connect to the bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. To do this: Go to the Systems Manager console. Select Session Manager . Click Start session . Select the radio button for the instance associated with the bastion host. Click Start session . The scripts you will be using are owned by the ec2-user account. Enter the command below to change your effective user id and directory to those of ec2-user: sudo su - ec2-user Display the current directory using this command: ls You will see two shell scripts. mysql.oldway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \"old\" way, using a hard-coded password. mysql.newway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \"new\" way, using AWS Secrets Manager. View the file mysql.oldway.sh using this command: cat mysql.oldway.sh You will see contents similar to the lines below. The values PASSWORD, USER, and ENDPOINT represent the hard-coded database password, username, and host endpoint. #/bin/bash # mysql.oldway.sh # This is the old way of accessing a database, with a hard-coded password. # This script will only work right after the CloudFormation template runs. # After you store and rotate the secret, you will need to use the # mysql.newway.sh script. mysql \\ -pPASSWORD \\ -u USER \\ -P 3306 \\ -h ENDPOINT Test the script mysql.oldway.sh using the commands shown below. The first command invokes the script. The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. Note that MySQL commands end with a semicolon (\";\"). ./mysql.oldway.sh use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \"old\" way, with a hard-coded user name and password. You may be wondering why MariaDB appears in the image below. Amazon Linux 2 includes the MariaDB port of the mysql command as an \"extras\" module. The mysql program is compatible with both MySQL and MariaDB. View the file mysql.newway.sh by entering this command: cat mysql.newway.sh As mentioned above, for the sake of simplicity, the scripts used in the tutorial use jq to parse the secret value into shell variables to allow for easy command line manipulation. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables, and work with them in plaintext at the command line. #/bin/bash # This is the new way of accessing a database, with AWS Secrets Manager. if [ $# -ne 1 ] then echo usage: $0 SecretName exit 1 fi secret=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id $1 --region us-east-1 | jq .SecretString | jq fromjson) user=$(echo $secret | jq -r .username) password=$(echo $secret | jq -r .password) endpoint=$(echo $secret | jq -r .host) port=$(echo $secret | jq -r .port) mysql \\ -p$password \\ -u $user \\ -P $port \\ -h $endpoint Run the mysql.newway.sh script by running the commands below. The first command invokes the script. Note that you must specify the name of the secret! In this example, the secret's name is smdemo . The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. ./mysql.newway.sh smdemo use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \"new\" way, using AWS Secrets Manager. Rotate the secret In this section, you will enable the rotation of the secret you created in AWS Secrets Manager. Go to the main screen of the AWS Secrets Manager console. Click on the secret that you previously created. Click Edit rotation . Select Enable automatic rotation . Choose 30 days for the rotation interval. Click Use this secret because we will be using the credentials of this secret to access the database and then rotate the same credentials. Click Save to begin the process. You will see a message telling you that the rotation is beginning and that you should remain on the page until it is complete. AWS Secrets Manager is now using the AWS Serverless Application Repository to install an AWS Lambda rotation function on your behalf. Do not leave this page until the rotation is complete. A message will appear when the rotation is complete. Refresh your browser window to update your any cached fields. Click Retrieve secret value to see the new password value. Access the database after the rotation Let's try to connect to the database again, both the \"old\" way with a hard-coded password, the \"new\" way with AWS Secrets Manager. On the bastion host, use the mysql.oldway.sh script again as you did before the rotation. You should receive an error message (access denied) because the mysql.oldway.sh script has the same hard-coded password.
