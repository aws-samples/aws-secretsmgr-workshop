Architecture Overview Here's a diagram of what we are going to build. This environment consists of a VPC in the us-east-1 region with two subnets. The subnets containts an Amazon EC2 bastion host running Amazon Linux 2 used for running AWS CLI commands and a private, not publicly-accessible, Amazon RDS MySQL database instance. The subnets are chosen based on the presence of a VPC endpoint for AWS Secrets Manager. When we initiate a rotation of the RDS database, the AWS Lambda function that Secrets Manager uses will reach out to the Amazon RDS database to perform the rotation. Security Note Security Note For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial uses jq to parse the secret value into environment variables to allow for easy command line manipulation. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables. Prerequisites In order to complete this workshop you'll need the following: * an AWS Account with administrator access to services used in the module including AWS Secrets Manager, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and Amazon VPC Charges You will incur charges for the services used in these modules. The pricing for each service is available on that service's pricing page. 1. Choose a region You need to choose a region that offers AWS Secrets Manager and Amazon RDS. For information about service availability, check the region table . Tip: The AWS region name is always listed in the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, in the navigation bar. Make a note of the AWS region name , for example, US East (N. Virginia) . For more information about regions, see: AWS Regions and Endpoints . 2. Complete initial environment configuration (expand for details) In this section, you will use AWS CloudFormation to build the environment shown in the diagram above. Complete all the steps below unless they are marked \"optional.\" 2.1. Download the AWS Cloudformation template and save it to your workstation. 2.2. In the AWS Management Console, Under Management Tools, Select CloudFormation . 2.3. Click the Create stack button. 2.4. Select the Upload a template to Amazon S3 radio button. 2.5. Click the Choose file button and use the file navigation pop-up to select the CloudFormation template you just downloaded. 2.6. Click the Next button. Enter the values below into Stack name and parameter fields: Field name Value Stack name You can choose or just use smdemo Enter the name of the database Accept the default value of smdemo Enter the TCP port for the database endpoint Accept the default value of 3306 Enter a prefix for the Name tag Accept the default value of smdemo Enter the value for the Project tag Accept the default value of smproj Enter the SSM AMI Id Parameter Accept the default value - Do not change! 2.7. Click the Next button. 2.8. On the Options page, click the Next button. 2.9. On the Review page, check the acknowledgement box and click the Create button. AWS CloudFormation will the build the resource stack. This may take 15-20 minutes to complete. Wait until the status of the stack changes to \"CREATE_COMPLETE.\" You can periodically refresh the page to update the status. If the stack creation fails, look at the bottom of the page and select the Events tab. You should be able to see the reason for the failure in the Status Reason column. A common reason for a failure is not having specified some of the parameters when creating the stack. 2.10. Let's take a look at the Output section of the CloudFormation stack. The outputs values include the RDS master username and password, both of which are set to random alphanumeric strings for added security. You will store the DBUser and DBPassword values as a secret in Secrets Manager. You will se the DBEndpoint value to help you select the correct database in Secrets Manager. Another output value is the IP address of the bastion host. You will need this IP address to set up a connection to the bastion host later in this module. Keep this window open. 3. Store the secret value in AWS Secrets Manager (expand for details) In this section, you will store the RDS database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. You will use the DBUser and DBPassword values that were output from the AWS CloudFormation. - __3.1.__ Open the [AWS Secrets Manager Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home) in a new tab or window. - __3.2.__ Click **Store a new secret**. - __3.3.__ Select the **Credentials for RDS database** radio button. - __3.4.__ Copy the values for the DBUser and DBPassword CloudFormation output values that you got from item 2.10 above into the **User name** and **Password** fields respectively. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will see a list of your RDS instances. Using the DBendpoint output value that you got from item 2.10 above, select the RDS instance. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 1](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore1.png) - __3.5.__ Click **Next**. - __3.6.__ Enter a name for the secret. You can pick a name or just use **smdemo** as shown below. Note that this must bot be the name of a secret that is pending deletion. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 2](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore2.png) - __3.7.__ Click **Next**. - __3.8__ Select **Disable automatic rotation** and then click **Next**. We will enable rotation later in this module. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 3](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore3.png) - __3.9.__ Click **Store**. You have now stored your secret value as shown below. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 4](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore4.png) 4. Connect to the Amazon EC2 bastion host and access the RDS database (expand for details) In this section, you will connect to the bastion host so you can run scripts that the CloudFormation template has created on the instance. ___Complete all the steps below unless they are marked \"optional.\"___ - __4.1.__ Connect to the bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. - __4.2.__ After you login, use the **sudo su ec2-user** command since the ec2-user id is the owner of all the scripts. - __4.3.__ Change to the home directory of the ec2-user id by entering the **cd** command without any arguments. - __4.4.__ Use the **ls** command to list the contents of the home directory. You will see two shell scripts. * mysql.oldway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \"old\" way, using a hard-coded password. * mysql.newway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \"new\" way, using AWS Secrets Manager. - __4.5.__ Let's take a look at the file mysql.oldway.sh. You can use the **cat** command to do this. In the example below, the values PASSWORD, USER, and ENDPOINT represent the hard-coded database password, username, and host endpoint. \u0002wzxhzdk:0\u0003 - __4.6.__ Now let's try this script by running the following commands. The first command invokes the script. The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. \u0002wzxhzdk:1\u0003 You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \"old\" way, with a hard-coded user name and password. You may be wondering why MariaDB appears in the image below. Amazon Linux 2 includes the MariaDB port of the **mysql** command as an \"extras\" module. The **mysql** program is compatible with both MySQL and MariaDB. ![AWS Secrets Manager old way before rotation](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSMSQLoldpre.png) - __4.7.__ Let's take a look at the file mysql.newway.sh. You can use the **cat** command to do this. As mentioned above, for the sake of simplicity, the scripts used in the tutorial use *jq* to parse the secret value into shell variables to allow for easy command line manipulation. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables, and work with them in plaintext at the command line. \u0002wzxhzdk:2\u0003 - __4.8.__ Now let's try this script by running the following commands. The first command invokes the script. **Note that you must specify the name of the secret!** The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. \u0002wzxhzdk:3\u0003 You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \"new\" way, using AWS Secrets Manager. ![AWS Secrets Manager new way before rotation](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSMSQLnewpre.png) 5. Enable AWS Secrets Manager and perform the first password rotation (expand for details) In this section, you will enable the rotation of the secret you created in AWS Secrets Manager. - __5.1.__ Go to the main screen of the AWS Secrets Manager console. - __5.2.__ Click on the secret that you previously created. - __5.3.__ Click **Edit rotation**. - __5.4.__ Select **Enable automatic rotation**. Choose **30 days** for the rotation interval. Click **Use this secret** because we will be using the credentials of this secret to access the database and then rotate the same credentials. Click **Save** to begin the process. ![AWS Secrets Manager rotation part 1](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSRotate1.png) - __5.5.__ You will see a message telling you that the rotation is beginning and that you should remain on the page until it is complete. AWS Secrets Manager is now using the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) to install an [AWS Lambda rotation](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function on your behalf. **Do not leave this page until the rotation is complete.** ![AWS Secrets Manager rotation part 2](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSRotate2.png) A message will appear when the rotation is complete. **Refresh your browser window to update your any cached fields.** ![AWS Secrets Manager rotation part 3](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSRotate3.png) - __5.6.__ Click **Retrieve secret value** to see the new password value. 6. Connect to the database after rotating the password (expand for details) Let's try to connect to the database again, both the \"old\" way with a hard-coded password, the \"new\" way with AWS Secrets Manager. - __6.1.__ On the bastion host, repeat step 4.6 with the **mysql.oldway.sh** script. You should receive an error message (access denied) because the mysql.oldway.sh script has the same hard-coded password. ![AWS Secrets Manager old way after rotation](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSMSQLoldpost.png) - __6.2.__ Repeat step 4.8 with the **mysql.newway.sh** script. You should be able to connect to the database just as you did before since this script uses AWS Secrets Manager to fetch the updated credentials. 7. Clean up (expand for details) Now that you have seen how AWS Secrets Manager can rotate the credentials for a private database, please follow these steps to remove the resources you created, including the private database. - __7.1.__ [Delete the secret you created in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_delete-restore-secret.html?shortFooter=true). Note that when you delete a secret, the deletion is scheduled for a minimum of seven days in the future. - __7.2.__ When you enabled rotation on your secret, AWS Secrets Manager used AWS CloudFormation to create an AWS Lambda function to do the rotation using the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/). Go to the AWS CloudFormation console and delete this stack. The name of the stack begins with the following string: **aws-serverless-repository-SecretsManagerRDSMySQLRotationSingleUser** Look for a stack with this naming convention that was created at about the same time as you enabled rotation. **Do not proceed to the next step until this stack has been deleted.** - __7.3.__ [Delete the main CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) that you created in steps 2.1 through 2.9. The stack deletion process may take several minutes to complete. If the stack deletion process either pauses or fails, it may be because of an Elastic Network Interface that gets created when rotation is enabled. If you delete this interface and restart the stack deletion. 8. Conclusion You have completed this module.

The name of the stack begins with the following string: **aws-serverless-repository-SecretsManagerRDSMySQLRotationSingleUser** Look for a stack with this naming convention that was created at about the same time as you enabled rotation. **Do not proceed to the next step until this stack has been deleted.** - __7.3.__ [Delete the main CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) that you created in steps 2.1 through 2.9.
